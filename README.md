# nanoid-good

Guarantees you will not get any profanity in your ids generated by [Nano ID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid).

This is a drop-in replacement for **Nano ID** which means you can just change the name of imported package from `nanoid` to `nanoid-good`.

## Installation

```shell
npm install nanoid-good
```

## Usage

```js
var nanoid = require("nanoid-good");
require("nanoid-good/locale/en"); // you should add locale of your preferred language
var id = nanoid(); //=> "V1StGXR8_Z5jdHi6B~myT"
```

All additional functions of **Nano ID** are supported too:

```js
var format = require("nanoid-good/format");
var generate = require("nanoid-good/generate");
var nonSecure = require("nanoid-good/non-secure");
require("nanoid-good/locale/en");

var id1 = format(random, "abcdef", 5);
var id2 = generate("1234567abcdef", 10);
var id3 = nonSecure();
```

## Localization

If you want to look for bad words in other languages, you can add their corresponding locales:

```js
var nanoid = require("nanoid-good");
require("nanoid-good/locale/de");
require("nanoid-good/locale/ru");
```
